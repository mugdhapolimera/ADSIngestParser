         <italic toggle="yes">Phospho&#173;rus Chemistry</italic> has been published jointly by de Gruyter in Europe and Xiamen Universi
ty press in China, but it is the subtitle <italic toggle="yes">The role of phospho&#173;rus in prebiotic chemistry</italic> that gives a
 good indication of the content and context of the book. Written by Professor Yufen Zhao and her colleagues, this book of 166 pages is v
ery thin as far as the number of pages is concerned but its chemical, biological and finally philosophical implications are remarkable. 
Being highly interested in the relationship between chemistry and biology, philosophy and the creation of life (<italic toggle="yes">e.g
.</italic> see the following article in <italic toggle="yes">The Conversation</italic>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https:

conversation-between-a-biologist-and-a-philosopher-has-man-become-a-semi-god-3-88911</ext-link>), I have been totally fascinated by the 
story that unfolds therein. In the book, the authors constantly and rightly refer to the famous Miller&#8211;Urey (or more simply Miller
) lightning experiment, which was published 66 years ago and where they created the basic molecules of life (bases of the nucleotides, a
mino acids) from chemicals (mainly ammonia, methane, hydrogen and water). This has led to prebiotic chemistry, and the work of the Zhao 
laboratory in Xiamen is part of that international effort. More specifically Zhao and her colleagues have contributed to revealing the i
mportance of including phospho&#173;rus in the prebiotic soup. For example the Miller experiment leads to the production of ten amino ac
ids but if PH<sub>3</sub> is added as a catalyst, then 19 different amino acids are detected. &#8216;Simple&#8217; chemical reactions ex
plain how the NH<sub>2</sub> of the amino acids can react with phospho&#173;rus to become phospho&#173;rylated (they then become N-phosp
ho&#173;rylated amino acids, designated as NPAAs) and how this modification via the formation of a transitory cyclic CAPA2 molecule in t
urn favors the creation of dipeptides, tripeptides <italic toggle="yes">etc.</italic>, leading to the possibility of creating small and 
increasingly complex proteins. They also propose convincing scenarios where NPAAs can serve as catalysts for the formation of nucleoside
s from the nitro&#173;gen-containing bases A, C, G and T, and also of lipids, the constituents of membranes. A very interesting section 
is devoted to the early genetic code where the information that may have first been encoded by a single base evolves into a system where
 two bases were needed and finally three in the current genetic code. Chemistry also suggests that in the original conditions where life
 appeared, minerals such as hy&#173;droxy&#173;apatite (a polymer of phosphate) have probably been used for heterogeneous catalysis. It 
seems that the group of Professor Zhao has been heavily involved in prebiotic chemistry (see for example a list of their publications at
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=upCz5CEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">https://scholar.google.ca/ci
tations?user=upCz5CEAAAAJ&amp;hl=en</ext-link>) contributing in particular to the identification of the dipeptide Ser-His as being one o
f the early biocatalysts (it can cleave DNA and proteins), but also to various chemical aspects of prebiotic chemistry. In particular, t
hey have published a number of papers where they studied the inclusion of iron or copper in synthetic reactions. This is actually one li
mitation of the current book, of course phosphate is essential, massive amounts are needed for biological systems to operate, but on the
 other hand as plant nutrition tells us, many other metals like copper, iron, manganese, selenium, nickel, zinc <italic toggle="yes">etc
.</italic> are needed in small quantities . It would have been nice to discuss this to some extent, especially as this group has obvious
ly experience and interest concerning the inclusion of metals in chemistry.</p>
      <p>Of course the book has strengths and weaknesses; on the weak side the command of English is not always perfect (for example the
y relate to the Miller&#8211;Urey experiment as Miler&#8211;Yuri) but it remains understandable although there are numerous bugs present
. Something that is also missing is an index, which would have been very useful for the reader, and a list of abbreviations. The figures
 are of good quality but the legends are very often on the minimal side. These imperfections aside, I strongly recommend reading this bo
ok if you are interested in prebiotic chemistry. It is a short read but it will, in ten successive chapters, explain to you how life has
 originated on Earth either in small ponds or in the dark chimneys in the ocean ridges with high temperature and high pressure. Obviousl
y the chemical nature of phosphate has been essential to drive the creation of amino acids and proteins, nucleotides and nucleic acids, 
lipids and membranes, in short, the major constituents of life. To me, life is a natural consequence of matter and thought is a natural 
consequence of life. Thus, given the time that it took to elaborate living and thinking systems I believe there is no mystery, it had to
 happen over the 3.5 to 4 billion years. I will end on a personal note; I was born in the exact year that the Miller experiment was publ
ished, and when I was 15, I was lucky enough to receive as a gift a book in French about biology in which the Stanley Miller experiment 
was explained, and it struck me at the time as being a very important step in biology. I actually regard it to be as important as the th
eory of Darwin on evolution or the deciphering of the genetic code. As a consequence I was extremely happy to read this book which highl
ights some refinements to the initial Miller experiment. So thank you to the Zhao team, and we can also congratulate Zhao for her enviro
nmental commitment (see references to this in her Wikipedia page at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w
iki/Zhao_Yufen">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_Yufen</ext-link>).</p>
